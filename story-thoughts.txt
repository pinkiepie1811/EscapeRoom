Both:


Player 1:
(wait idk like 10 sec. or if we feeling fancy when p2 flips a switch. start the (10 min?) timer at this point)

As you consider your situation, the cracks in the wall in front of you start to glow brighter, before they abruptly split apart into a pathway. You poke your head in, and realize you there looks to be a set of tunnels ahead. However, the glow in the walls is limited to your room- if you step in you will be walking in the dark. Still, you have little other choice.

ENTER THE MAZE.


Player 2:
Other than the cracks, the room you are in is empty, save for a strange lever almost directly in front of where you woke up. Pull the lever? (use ":y" or ":n" as input)

You pull the lever. The cracks on the wall shine brighter for a moment, only to shift- moving to form.... what looks like a map of a maze? Curious. Maybe this will be relevant to your new friend.
