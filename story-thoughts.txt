Have talking in lower half of game form screen maybe. we could seperate that form into two windows.

Both:
You wake up. Taking a look around, you see you are trapped in a stone chamber. You hear the faint trickle of water, and a strange light seems to glow from the cracks in the wall. Even as you look, these cracks grow wider: the room is vibrating, and every so often, the sound of earth collapsing and rocks crashing into themselves echoes from beyond. You need to escape before it is too late!

Your phone starts to buzz in your pocket, but when you check it out, it has no signal. Instead, it seems a strange app has taken over your whole screen! It looks like... a text editor? You try typing something in.

(make sure p1 and p2 both send each other a message.)

What's this? It seems someone else is on the other end of this line- maybe they are stuck too. Perhaps you can use this strange app to communicate, and maybe even help each other escape!


Player 1:
(wait idk like 10 sec. or if we feeling fancy when p2 flips a switch. start the (10 min?) timer at this point)

As you consider your situation, the cracks in the wall in front of you start to glow brighter, before they abruptly split apart into a pathway. You poke your head in, and realize you there looks to be a set of tunnels ahead. However, the glow in the walls is limited to your room- if you step in you will be walking in the dark. Still, you have little other choice.

ENTER THE MAZE.


Player 2:
Other than the cracks, the room you are in is empty, save for a strange lever almost directly in front of where you woke up. Pull the lever? (use ":y" or ":n" as input)

You pull the lever. The cracks on the wall shine brighter for a moment, only to shift- moving to form.... what looks like a map of a maze? Curious. Maybe this will be relevant to your new friend.
