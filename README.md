# EscapeRoom

## Introduction
In the current time of the pandemic world, making things accessible online or in other
formats that maintain the safety of everyone has become crucial. This idea is especially prevalent
for those who are immunocompromised and cannot afford to live life the way it was before
COVID-19 without severe health risks. Hence, we strive to make one aspect of entertainment,
that was at first almost exclusively only accessible in person, attainable for all. Namely, we will
be creating a virtual escape room. 

## Implementation/Program Description [will be added later]

## maze.txt is the text file that contains our maze. We read in the file to generate the maze in the game.
